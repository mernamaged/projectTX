                    Ancient Egypt was a civilization in Northeast Africa situated in the Nile Valley. Ancient Egyptian civilization followed prehistoric Egypt and coalesced around 3100 BC (according to conventional Egyptian chronology)[1] with the political 
                    unification of Upper and Lower Egypt under Menes (often identified with Narmer).[2] 
                    The history of ancient Egypt occurred as a series of stable kingdoms, separated by periods of relative instability known as Intermediate Periods: the Old Kingdom of the Early Bronze Age, the Middle Kingdom of the Middle Bronze Age and the New Kingdom of the Late Bronze Age.

                    Ancient Greece was a northeastern Mediterranean civilization, existing from the Greek Dark Ages of the 12th–9th
                     centuries BC to the end of classical antiquity (c. AD 600), that comprised a loose collection of culturally and linguistically 
                     related city-states and other territories. Most of these regions were officially unified only once, for 13 years, under Alexander the Great's empire from 336 to 323 BC 
                     (though this excludes a number of Greek city-states free from Alexander's jurisdiction in the western Mediterranean, around the Black Sea, Cyprus, and Cyrenaica). 
                     In Western history, the era of classical antiquity was immediately followed by the Early Middle Ages and the Byzantine period.

                    In modern historiography, ancient Rome refers to Roman civilisation from the founding of the city of Rome in the 8th century BC to the collapse of the Western Roman Empire in the 5th century AD. It encompasses the Roman Kingdom 
                    (753–509 BC), Roman Republic (509–27 BC) and Roman Empire (27 BC–476 AD) until the fall of the western empire.
                    Ancient Rome began as an Italic settlement, traditionally dated to 753 BC, beside the River Tiber in the Italian Peninsula. The settlement grew into the city and polity of Rome,
                    and came to control its neighbours through a combination of treaties and military strength.
