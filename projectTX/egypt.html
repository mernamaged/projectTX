                <h1>THE ERA OF PHARAOHS</h1>
                <p class="content-paragraph">The history of ancient Egypt spans the period from the early prehistoric settlements of the northern Nile valley to the Roman conquest of Egypt in 30 BC. <br>
                The pharaonic period, the period in which Egypt was ruled by a pharaoh, is dated from the 32nd century BC, when Upper and Lower Egypt were unified, until the country fell under Macedonian rule in 332 BC.
                Historians usually group the history of ancient Egypt into three major kingdoms called the Old Kingdom, the Middle Kingdom, and the New Kingdom. It was during these times that ancient Egypt was at its strongest. 
                The times between the Kingdoms are called intermediate periods.<br>
                <h1>Pyramids and Treasure</h1> <br>
                The pharaohs of Egypt were often buried in giant pyramids or in secret tombs. <br>
                They believed that they needed treasure to be buried with them to help them in the afterlife. <br>
                As a result, archeologists have a lot of well preserved artifacts and tombs to examine in order to find out how the ancient Egyptians lived.

                        He ruled the country at a time of conflict, when battles over land raged between Egypt and the neighboring kingdom of Nubia.
                        Nearly a decade after coming to power, the young leader died at about 18. But historians didn't know much about Tut until 1922.

                    Her reign lasted from 51 BC to 30 BC during which she proved herself to be an eminent leader. 
                    The kingdom of Egypt prospered under her reign as various reforms were introduced to improve the Egyptian economy. 
                    Her foreign relations, both personal and political, proved to be of great value to the kingdom and led to much prosperous foreign trading.</p>
