        <p> Caesar Augustus, also known as Octavian, was the first Roman emperor; he reigned from 27 BC until his death in AD 14. He is known for being the founder of the Roman Principate,
             which is the first phase of the Roman Empire, and is considered one of the greatest leaders in human history.<br><br>
             Originally named Gaius Octavius, he was born into an old and wealthy equestrian branch of the plebeian gens Octavia. His maternal great-uncle Julius Caesar was assassinated in 44 BC, and Octavius was named in Caesar's will as his adopted son and heir; as a result, 
                he inherited Caesar's name, estate, and the loyalty of his legions.

        <p>Aristotle was known as the ‘ philosopher’ or ‘the master’. He grew up with his parents who were both in the medical field.<br>
            <br>He founded a small school called the Lyceum. French secondary schools-the ‘ lycees’-are named in honour of this venture. He liked to walk about while teaching and discussing ideas.<br> His followers are  ‘peripatetics’- the’ wanderers’.
            
            is many books lecture notes. Aristotle was fascinated by how many things work and questioned every working mechanism of everything in the world. For him, philosophy was about practical wisdom.</p>

    <p>Sophocles was one of the three greatest tragedians of Ancient Greece; Aeschylus was his predecessor, and Euripides was his antecedent.<br>

        <br> His work includes a remarkable collection of classics such as Oedipus the King, Antigone and Women of Trachis. His tragedies are windows into the worlds of the then Greek period: its society, polity and religion. 
         Sophocles first innovated much of what we know today as gory and quirky elements peppered into dramas and movies today in his theatres such as in Oedipus.</p>
