        <p><b>The Roman Empire was founded when Augustus Caesar proclaimed himself the first emperor of Rome in 
            31BC and came to an end with the fall of Constantinople in 1453CE</b>
        <br><br>
        The Roman Empire began with the reign of Emperor Augustus. The power of the Senate was limited and became an organ to support the emperor. 
        The period between Augustus and Diocletian is called High Empire, while the Low Empire is the era 
        between Diocletian and the fall of the Roman Empire in the West.</p>

        <p> Caesar Augustus, also known as Octavian, was the first Roman emperor; he reigned from 27 BC until his death in AD 14. He is known for being the founder of the Roman Principate,
             which is the first phase of the Roman Empire, and is considered one of the greatest leaders in human history.<br><br>
             Originally named Gaius Octavius, he was born into an old and wealthy equestrian branch of the plebeian gens Octavia. His maternal great-uncle Julius Caesar was assassinated in 44 BC, and Octavius was named in Caesar's will as his adopted son and heir; as a result, 
                he inherited Caesar's name, estate, and the loyalty of his legions.

    <p>Nero was the fifth Roman emperor and final emperor of the Julio-Claudian dynasty, reigning from AD 54 until his death in AD 68.
         He was adopted by the Roman emperor Claudius at the age of 13 and succeeded him on the throne. Nero was popular with the members of his Praetorian Guard and lower-class commoners in Rome and its provinces, but he was deeply resented by the Roman aristocracy. Most contemporary sources describe him as tyrannical, self-indulgent, and debauched. 
        After being declared a public enemy by the Roman Senate, he committed suicide at age 30.<br><br>
        His mother married the emperor Claudius, who eventually adopted Nero as his heir; when Claudius died in 54, Nero became emperor with the support of the Praetorian Guard and the Senate.</p>
